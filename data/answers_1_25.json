    "explanation": "The correct answer is **C. Segmentation**. Legacy IoT devices often cannot be patched quickly (or at all). Network segmentation isolates vulnerable devices into restricted VLANs/subnets with tight firewall rules, limiting exposure and reducing the chance a compromise spreads.",

      "A": "Insurance transfers financial risk; it does not reduce the technical exposure of an unpatched IoT vulnerability.",

      "C": "Correct. Segmentation is a fast, practical mitigation when patching is not feasible.",
