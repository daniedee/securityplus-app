    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "studyGuideTopic": "API security / API gateway",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B. API gateway**. API gateways enforce policies like IP allow lists, authentication, rate limiting, and request validation\u2014ideal for restricting API calls to approved IP ranges.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "A VPN provides encrypted connectivity, but it doesn\u2019t inherently enforce per-API IP allow-list policies for Internet-facing APIs.",
      "B": "Correct. API gateways can restrict access by IP ranges and apply security policies to API traffic.",
      "C": "A load balancer distributes traffic; it doesn\u2019t provide full API policy enforcement (auth, throttling, validation) the way an API gateway does.",
      "D": "DNSSEC protects DNS records; it does not restrict API calls by source IP."

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "studyGuideTopic": "Malware / Trojan symptoms",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **C. Trojan**. Unverified software that causes system slowdown/high resource usage is consistent with a trojan (malicious code disguised as legitimate), which may install additional malware or run unwanted processes.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "A worm is defined by self-spreading behavior; the symptom described centers on installing unverified software and subsequent performance impact.",
      "B": "A logic bomb triggers on a condition/time; it doesn\u2019t typically cause immediate ongoing resource drain right after installation.",
      "C": "Correct. Trojans often arrive as \u201cunverified software\u201d and can run hidden malicious processes that degrade performance.",
      "D": "Adware can slow systems, but the scenario emphasizes unverified software installation and broad malicious behavior; trojan is the best overall fit."

    "studyGuideTopic": "Risk management / Business impact analysis",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **A. BIA**. A Business Impact Analysis helps an organization understand potential impacts of disruptions/risks on business processes and prioritize what matters most\u2014an important part of evaluating risk impact (and often used alongside likelihood assessments).",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "BIA is the best fit among the options because it directly evaluates business impact and supports prioritization for risk decisions.",
      "B": "MTBF is a reliability metric (time between failures) and doesn\u2019t assess overall business risk likelihood/impact.",
      "C": "RPO defines acceptable data loss in time (backup/recovery metric), not general risk likelihood and impact analysis.",
      "D": "ARO measures likelihood/frequency, but it doesn\u2019t evaluate business impact on its own; BIA is the broader impact-focused analysis tool here."

    "studyGuideTopic": "Incident response / First action",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B. Containment**. After detecting unauthorized access, the first priority is to contain the incident\u2014limit further compromise and stop spread\u2014while preserving evidence for investigation.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "Notifying management is important, but containment reduces immediate risk and ongoing damage first.",
      "B": "Correct. Containment isolates affected systems and limits attacker movement and impact.",
      "C": "Replacing the server is premature and can destroy evidence; containment and investigation should happen first.",
      "D": "Resetting all passwords may be part of remediation, but immediate containment comes first to stop active compromise."

    "studyGuideTopic": "Wireless security / Protocol strength",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **C. WPA3**. WPA3 is the newest and strongest common Wi\u2011Fi security protocol listed, offering stronger encryption and improved handshake protections compared to WPA/WPA2.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "WPA (original) is older and less secure than WPA2/WPA3.",
      "B": "WPA2 is strong when configured correctly, but WPA3 improves protections (e.g., SAE) and is considered stronger overall.",
      "C": "Correct. WPA3 provides the strongest wireless security among the listed options.",
      "D": "WEP is obsolete and broken; it is the weakest option."
