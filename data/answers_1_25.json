      "A": "Packet capture is useful but not a central log aggregation approach across systems.",
      "B": "Correct. Centralized logging consolidates logs for faster investigations and correlation.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is **C. Privacy concerns**. TLS inspection decrypts user traffic, exposing sensitive content and creating privacy and compliance considerations along with sensitive key handling risks.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "Encryption overhead/latency can be a performance issue, but the primary security concern is exposure of decrypted content and privacy/compliance risk.",
      "B": "Key rotation is a best practice; it doesn\u2019t represent the concern of inspection itself.",
      "C": "Correct. Decrypting traffic raises privacy/compliance concerns and increases sensitivity of inspection infrastructure.",
      "D": "Load balancing is unrelated; it doesn\u2019t address decryption/privacy risk."

    "feedback": {
      "A": "Backups help recovery, but they don\u2019t protect the confidentiality of data on a stolen device.",
      "B": "Correct. Full disk encryption protects laptop data at rest if the device is stolen.",

      "A": "Correct. MFA makes stolen passwords alone insufficient for access.",

    "correctAnswer": "B",

      "A": "SameSite cookies help with CSRF mitigation, not XSS script execution control.",
      "B": "Correct. CSP limits where scripts/content can be loaded from, mitigating XSS.",

    "feedback": {
      "A": "A reverse proxy protects/optimizes inbound traffic to servers; it is not primarily for controlling employee outbound browsing.",
