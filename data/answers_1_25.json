    "studyGuideTopic": "Threat actors / Motivation",
    "explanation": "The best answer is **Organized crime**. Organized crime groups are profit-driven, often well-resourced, and can be hired or directed (directly or indirectly) to conduct sophisticated attacks. That makes them a plausible proxy for a foreign government seeking capability and deniability.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "Hacktivists are typically motivated by ideology or a cause, not hired services for targeted state-directed operations.",
      "B": "Whistleblowers expose wrongdoing from inside an organization; they are not generally contracted attackers of foreign critical infrastructure.",
      "C": "Correct. Organized crime groups can act as paid operators, providing capability and deniability for the sponsor.",

    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "studyGuideTopic": "Cryptography / Hashing",
    "explanation": "**Salting** adds a unique random value to the original data (e.g., a password) before hashing. This increases complexity and helps prevent precomputed attacks (like rainbow tables) by ensuring identical passwords do not produce identical hashes.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "Key stretching makes password guessing slower by increasing the work factor (many rounds), but it is not the step that adds a unique random value before hashing.",
      "B": "Data masking hides or obfuscates data for viewing/use; it doesn’t strengthen the input to a one-way transformation algorithm.",
      "C": "Steganography hides data inside other data (like images); it’s unrelated to strengthening a hash input.",
      "D": "Correct. Salting adds uniqueness/complexity *before* hashing, which is exactly what the question asks."

    "studyGuideTopic": "Social engineering / Phishing",
    "explanation": "This is **phishing**. The user was lured via email to a link, entered credentials, and then saw an error page—commonly used to reduce suspicion after credential capture.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "Brand impersonation can be used in phishing, but the defining behavior here is credential capture via a deceptive link and fake login flow.",
      "B": "Pretexting is a fabricated scenario used to persuade a target (often through dialogue). Here the mechanism is an email link to a credential-harvesting page.",
      "C": "Typosquatting is using a lookalike domain name; it may support phishing, but the described attack is phishing itself.",
      "D": "Correct. Phishing is the direct technique used: email lure → fake login → credential capture."

    "studyGuideTopic": "Network security / ACLs / DNS",
    "explanation": "To ensure outbound DNS traffic originates **only** from 10.50.10.25, you must **permit** DNS (port 53) from source **10.50.10.25/32** to any destination, then **deny all** other outbound DNS. Option **D** expresses that logic correctly.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "This permits DNS from everyone (0.0.0.0/0) and then denies the allowed host—this fails the requirement.",
      "B": "This reverses the source/destination logic; it does not correctly enforce “originates only from 10.50.10.25”.",
      "C": "This again misapplies the matching/deny logic and doesn’t correctly enforce the stated origin constraint.",
      "D": "Correct. Permit source 10.50.10.25/32 to any destination on port 53, then deny all other outbound traffic (or at least all other DNS), matching the requirement."

      "A": "Correct. SSO is designed for using existing enterprise credentials to access multiple applications/services, including SaaS.",
      "B": "LEAP is an older EAP method used primarily for certain wireless authentication scenarios; it’s not the standard approach for SaaS access with domain credentials.",
      "C": "MFA strengthens authentication, but it does not by itself provide the cross-application domain-to-SaaS access mechanism.",

    "explanation": "**Business Email Compromise (BEC)** commonly involves impersonating an executive or trusted party to convince an employee to send money or purchase items (like gift cards). The gift-card request using an executive’s display name is a classic BEC/CEO-fraud scenario.",
    "feedback": {
      "A": "Correct. Executive impersonation to induce fraudulent payment/purchase is a hallmark of BEC.",
      "B": "A ransom message after opening an attachment describes ransomware delivery, not BEC.",
      "C": "Asking for cloud admin credentials is more consistent with spear phishing/credential theft than the payment-redirection pattern of BEC.",

    "feedback": {
      "A": "An NGFW provides strong network controls, but WAFs are specialized for application-layer (HTTP/S) inspection and web attack patterns.",
      "B": "Correct. A WAF is designed to protect web apps by filtering/blocking malicious web requests and payload signatures.",

    "feedback": {
      "A": "Rainbow tables are used to crack hashed passwords, not plaintext passwords already revealed in a file.",
      "B": "Correct. Credential harvesting is collecting credentials from sources like config files, memory, or phishing pages.",

    "feedback": {
      "A": "File encryption can protect specific files, but it’s easier to misconfigure and may leave metadata/other data exposed compared to device-wide protection.",

    "feedback": {
      "A": "VPN logs show remote access patterns; they won’t reliably detect local unauthorized software installs.",

      "A": "Correct. Regression testing is used to confirm expected behavior still works after remediation/changes.",

    "feedback": {
      "A": "Correct. IDS monitors and alerts—detective control.",
